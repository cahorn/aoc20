    A solution can be computed efficiently with textbook bottom-up dynamic
    programming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Computer_programming

    Sadly, as Python does not have support for recursive list definitions,
    one-lining the solution as a zip with an accumulator function and a bitmask
    (Ã  la d10.hs:9) is not possible. :'(
